  </br>
  
    In Virtualization and Containers, you should have learned:

    Virtualization allows a single, physical, host computer to support a number of virtual 'guests' that have their own, independent, operating system.
    Some types of virtualization are:
    Desktop virtualization, which includes virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and local desktop virtualization.
    Network virtualization, which includes software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV).
    Application virtualization, which includes local application virtualization, application streaming, and server-based application virtualization.
    Server virtualization, which allows for multiple virtual servers to share the same hardware via a hypervisor.
    The benefits of virtualization are resource efficiency, easier management, minimal downtime, and faster provisioning.
    Containers are software that contains the necessary components to run in any environment without the need for physical components. It is portable and lightweight and streamlined to work in any environment.

  </br>
  
    In Serverless, you should have learned:

    Serverless environments are built on a server infrastructure, however, they are invisible in the sense that the clients do not see, manage, or interact with the servers.
    Serverless allows developers to focus on their apps instead of having to focus on managing servers.

    By migrating workloads to a cloud, organizations can improve operational performance and agility, workload flexibility and scalability, and security.
    There are many benefits to migrating workflows to the cloud including, but not limited to, scalability, cost-effectiveness, security, and accelerated adoption. 
    Using the available general solutions options can make the transition flow smoothly and on schedule. 
    As part of planning a cloud migration, it is important to consider the costs involved and the potential risks that may be encountered.
    There are risks and challenges with cloud computing when migrating to the cloud. These include, but are not limited to, data security, legal, regulatory, and compliance issues, and disaster recovery.

<details>
  <summary> Define Identity and Access Management </summary>
   
    In IAM Defined, you should have learned that:

    Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables customers to securely authenticate users for platform services and control access to resources across the IBM Cloud platform.
    IAM uses access policies to assign users and service IDs access to the resources within an enterprise account.
    Access policies are how users, service IDs, and access groups in an account are given permission to access and take actions on account resources. Policies include a subject, target, and role.
    The value of using a single resource group and a single access group containing all the users that need the resources in the resource group, is a single policy can be configured that grants access to all resources in the resource group.  
    Customers requiring enhanced security can require multifactor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security to an account by requiring all users to authenticate using an additional authentication factor beyond an ID and password.

</br>
    In Assigning Access to Resources, you should have learned that:

    To assign access to resources in IAM, the account administrator must identify or create access groups, invite users to the account, and then manage the user access.

</br>

    In Service and Platform Roles, you should have learned that:

    Service access roles define a user or service’s ability to perform actions on a service instance, such as accessing the console or performing API calls. There are three possible service access roles: manager, writer, and reader. 
    Platform management roles cover a range of actions, including the ability to create and delete instances, manage aliases, bindings, and credentials, and manage access. These roles, as the name suggests, enable management of the platform itself. Through them, users are granted a number of privileges, including the ability to create instances, manage service IDs, manage users and permissions, and create resource groups.

</br>

    In IAM Scenario: Three Teams Working on Three Projects, you should have learned that:

    Account administrators require account to All Identity and Access services and the specific platform access role for administrators.
