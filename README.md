  <h3> <strong> 1- Define ‘the cloud’ and why people use it </h3>

In The Cloud, you should have learned:

        •	Cloud computing is on-demand network access to shared resources.
        •	The cloud deployment models are public, private, and hybrid.
    
</br>

In Characteristics and Benefits of Cloud Computing, you should have learned:

        •	The five characteristics of cloud computing are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.
        •	One of the benefits of cloud computing is cost-effectiveness.
        •	It is also efficient and flexible since there are prebuilt tools and storage options available for the clients. Cloud computing allows users to collaborate and quickly get their products out to the public.
